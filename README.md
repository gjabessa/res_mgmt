# restaurant-app


This app works with backend.

The following Android technologies were used:

Material Design Theme, light. 
Livedata
ViewModel
Fragment
ViewPager
RecyclerView
DataBinding
Room (For local data persistence) 
Retrofit 
Glide
Coroutine: I also tried to implement coroutine on drag and drop for recycler view by making it to delay for some seconds before the onDragListener is set, because it will not bind the datas if the listener is set before the data is ready on the layout.

How to setup
1.Run the backend
2.create a hotspot from network or use ip-address:3000
3. Convert base url to backend ip address in api client code
4. Build and run
